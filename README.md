ConVEX
======

The future home (perhaps) of ConVEX

The ConVEX firmware library is an add on package for the ChibiOS/RT
operating system that supports the VEX cortex microcontroller.
The library adds the necessary functionality to allow C applications to be
created and executed on the cortex that can access its available hardware.
